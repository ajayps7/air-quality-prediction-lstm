# air-quality-prediction-lstm
Designed and implemented an end-to-end air quality prediction system using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal patterns in multivariate environmental time-series data. Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and sequence modeling, followed by model evaluation using RMSE and MAE. Developed exploratory and analytical visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze trends, seasonality, and prediction accuracy. Deployed the trained model through a FastAPI-based backend served with Uvicorn, enabling scalable inference. Built an interactive Streamlit frontend for real-time prediction and visualization, following a modular architecture with clear separation between modeling, API, and presentation layers.
