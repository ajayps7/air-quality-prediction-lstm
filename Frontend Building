**Streamlit Frontend Description**

The Streamlit application serves as an interactive web interface for Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction using a trained LSTM model. It allows users to input environmental and pollutant data, preprocesses those inputs to match the model’s expectations, and displays the predicted AQI in real time.

Application initialization and layout

The app starts by setting a clear title and short description that communicates its purpose: predicting AQI using a deep learning model.

The trained LSTM model and the saved MinMax scalers (for features and target) are loaded at startup. Loading happens once, ensuring fast predictions without retraining or refitting during user interaction.

User input interface

The frontend uses Streamlit widgets to collect numerical inputs corresponding exactly to the features used during model training. These include:

Pollutant concentrations (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, CO, SO₂, O₃, etc.)

Engineered AQI features such as:

Previous AQI values (lag features)

Rolling AQI averages

Each input field enforces numeric input, preventing invalid data types from reaching the model.

Input preprocessing (frontend-aligned with training)

Once the user provides values:

Inputs are assembled into a single-row pandas DataFrame with the same column order as the training feature set.

The feature scaler (loaded from disk) transforms the input data into the normalized [0, 1] range.

The scaled data is reshaped into a 3D tensor with shape:

(1, time_steps, number_of_features)


This shape is mandatory for LSTM inference and mirrors the structure used during training.

No preprocessing logic is duplicated or improvised—the frontend strictly reuses the saved preprocessing artifacts.

Prediction trigger

A Predict AQI button controls inference execution.
The model does nothing until the user explicitly clicks the button, avoiding unnecessary computation and accidental predictions.

Model inference and postprocessing

When prediction is triggered:

The LSTM model generates a scaled AQI prediction.

The target scaler inversely transforms this value back to the original AQI scale.

The result is converted into a readable numeric value.

Output display

The predicted AQI is displayed prominently on the interface, clearly labeled and easy to interpret.

The UI focuses on:

One prediction at a time

Immediate feedback

Zero technical clutter for end users

Error safety and stability

Because:

Inputs are constrained to numeric widgets

Feature order is fixed

Scalers and model are preloaded

The frontend minimizes runtime errors and ensures the model always receives valid, correctly shaped data.
